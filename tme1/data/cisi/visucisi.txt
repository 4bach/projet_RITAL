18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications
.A
Comaromi, J.P.
.W
   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical Libraries
.A 
Slater, M.
.W
This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.
Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use.  Information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no
account of documents used outside the library, still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred.
Taking technical information transfer as a whole,
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one.  There are users of technical information -
particularly in technology rather than science -
who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk
collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations.  Even regular library users also receive
information in other ways.

Two Kinds of Power
An Essay on Bibliographic Control
.A
Wilson, P.
.W
    The relationships between the organization and control of writings
and the organization and control of knowledge and information will
inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a
great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical
control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,
as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense
power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written
form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of
knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as
simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

Systems Analysis of a University Library; 
final report and research project
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly 
stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic
libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but
although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.
The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which,
in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision.

A Library Management Game:
a report on a research project
.A
Brophy, P.
.W
    Although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety
of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,
from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional
men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"
has been the rapid development of sophisticated management
techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which
have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods
.A
Borko, H.
.W
     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a 
how-to-do-it course.
It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,
the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing
industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product.
These topics we call concepts.
     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.
These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix.
There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.
     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past.
Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.
Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computer-prepared abstracts and extracts.
Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,
select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.
The benefits of this research are discussed.
    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.
Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or
volunteer workers.
Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.
One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

architects face in planning new college and university library
buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does
not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by

The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle
.A
Farber, E.I.
.W
     As important for staff members' individual development
as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most
significant attitude one acquired while working for
Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must
be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the
materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his
respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and
reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in
his admonition that, though we were primarily a research
library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to
collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It
was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be
responsible for these as well as for "general" books which crossed
disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books
which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is
apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,
"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with
books through a reading of critical reviews and the books
themselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,
and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the
need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was
continually impressed upon us.

Access to Libraries in College
.A
Hyman, R.T.
.W
     This study assumed that an additional use study held
less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.
The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and
current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering
instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.
     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:
     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach
and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and
evidently resistant to established methods of use and user
research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was
confirmed.
     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification
and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,
social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect
his democratic self-realization.
     Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgence
by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education
for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his
research.

Access to Periodical Resources
.A
Palmour, V.E.
.W
          The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate,
and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical
resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans
are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being
satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in
the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is
the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring,
storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.
          This study focused on the physical access to the
periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community,
design features were developed, and included the following:
          Service should be made available to all users
          without any restriction other than access
          through a library.
          Initially, the service should be confined primarily
          to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of
          journal articles.
          The collection of a center should be comprehensive
          in subject coverage excluding only medicine.
          All worthwhile journals should be collected
          irrespective of language.

  The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction,
acknowledges the importance of selection policy,
serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions.
These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate
to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly
in books and papers that are cited in the references and the
bibliographic note.
  Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of
major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in
this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and
problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice.
For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is
referred to the references cited.  For automation these references
are only a modest selection from an enormous literature.

Acquisition from the 3rd World
.A
Clarke, D.A.
.W
  The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up
in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of
establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of
Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in
particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of
the services these libraries provide.
  At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972,
LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the
'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this
seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of
acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for
reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre
for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision
of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be
a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications
from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the
cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19
September 1973.

The Administration of the College Library
.A
Lyle, G.R.
.W
  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but
frequently neglected principle that college library service goes
beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and
storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and
circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching
process with reference service, to afford faculty members library
opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students
to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a
service activity, a tool through which library functions are more
fully and efficiently realized.
  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,
but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was
planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library
administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because
readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful
for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in
some cases extended.

Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System
.A
Matthis, R.E.
.W
     This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change
efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed
procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of
suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text
deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the
preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which
are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable
attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC
Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In
addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most
frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been
thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of
comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of
catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users,
a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying
machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography
of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is
included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the
tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized

Adventures in Librarianship
.A
Voigt, M.J.
.B
1970
.W
  There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide
scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of
librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular
current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of
the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in
Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will
present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,
research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.
   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts
of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all
librarians who can visualize its potential.
Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.
As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change
has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been
found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts
expected.
Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of
automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope
to get there.
"The Machine and Cataloging" reviews the current status of the machine-produced
book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.
Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as
reported in "Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."
Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the
future, not the past.
One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of
catalog information is that discussed in "Filing Systems for Computer
Manipulation."
This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests
possible solutions.
   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate
knowledge of the facts.
As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of
traditional operations become essential.
The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult
and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.
   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much
more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the
instructional media center.
Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible
major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in
the public library.
Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that
what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.
   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.
   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial
planning theory have for libraries.
The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in
administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.
   The article on library development in developing countries provides an
analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other
countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern
world.

Selective Dissemination of Information
.A
Mauerhoff, G.R.
.B
1974
.W
  The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally,
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as
reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn
(1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing
ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation,
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies,
government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the
last fourteen years.
